# Hello Quantum

This application first entangles two qubits which were initially in the state *|00‚ü©*.
Then, compare the results by running the same circuit on a simulator and real quantum hardware at IBM.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org)
